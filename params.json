{"name":"Odin","body":"# Odin\r\nOdin is a system to run arbitrary programs on your cluster.\r\n\r\nCurrently there is no scheduler.\r\n\r\nIt is a proof of concept at the moment and is terribly inefficient and threaded\r\nbadly.\r\n\r\nBuilt on:\r\n\r\n * [ZooKeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/)\r\n * [supervisord](http://supervisord.org)\r\n * [Protocol Buffers](http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers)\r\n * [supervisor_twiddler](https://github.com/mnaberez/supervisor_twiddler)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Terms:\r\n * Runnable: a command and configuration to run a program on a single machine\r\n   which will be monitored.\r\n * Task: A single instance of a job. Contains a single runnable, information for \r\n   where to get program and files.\r\n * Job: A set of tasks (each with multiple instances). A user creates a Job to be\r\n   run somewhere on the cluster.\r\n * Machine: A computer where many tasks will run. Runs a supervisord instance.\r\n   It has an IP.\r\n * Politician (Need a better name): A server that may become the leader of the\r\n   cluster. A politician schedules jobs on the cluster and accepts Jobs to be\r\n   added to the cluster. Only one politician is in charge, they are the Leader.\r\n   Leaders are elected through a ZooKeeper based algorithm.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Creating Jobs\r\n create_job(command = 'cat',\r\n \t\t\targs = ['--port=%PORT%', '--input=file',],\r\n \t\t\tdata = ['ftp://files/some/file'],\r\n \t\t\tcell = 'test',\r\n \t\t\tminimum = 1,\r\n \t\t\tmaximum = 2,\r\n \t\t\t)","tagline":"Run arbitrary programs on your cluster.
